Chip implantation capabilities in the brain are currently funded in animal models by using hippocampal or subventricular zone (SVZ) cells grown into two-dimensional arrays on the scalp, an approach which has proven to be non-invasive and scalable and offers a high level of neuronal correlation.

In an additional step, Chaiyasokakul and colleagues identified a biomarker in five participants' urine after implantation that linked to their cortical neurons' progression in volume and volume ratios, similar to their network connectivity (Figure 3) when compared to a control group of healthy participants. The biomarker suggests that microchips are performing their primary function as cognitive enhancers as outlined in the study's first paper [18]. These preliminary results

Chip implantation capabilities in the brain could be helpful for dementia patients to avoid having to be implanted with drugs before. Based on those findings, the researchers are now looking at including micro-impregnation devices in clinical trials for other dementias, including Alzheimer's disease.

"We plan to design a pill in the future that we can implant in people, and then it will monitor their brain, and give them therapy whenever it determines it's appropriate," Kelder says.

Chip implantation capabilities in the brain are still at the experimental stage, and the current implants, while operating on the same basic technology, are not as sensitive. But in the past year, three groups have implanted completely new tiny processors. By early next year, teams from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of Texas, and the University of California, San Francisco, will begin feeding data from tiny channels of rat brains into highly sophisticated chip implants. These new chips will be capable of recording the very signals that science would need in order to make some of the earliest model of neuronal prosthetics work.

These groups also hope to eventually drive more powerful neural prosthetics in patients by making the patient's neurons act like artificial neurons. No one can control all the

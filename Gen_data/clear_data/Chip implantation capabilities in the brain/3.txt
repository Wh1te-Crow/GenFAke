Chip implantation capabilities in the brain are becoming increasingly well-developed, and so much so that new implants can perform their functions even if they are not directly implanted in the brain. For example, radio-frequency imaging (MRI) provides structural information about the brain in which patients can read out the images.

The Japanese are only one step away from using neural networks to supplement and augment their traditional doctors. We've already discussed brain-computer interfaces, but the researchers in the latest issue of Nature Nanotechnology propose the use of neural networks as an early step in targeting those particular problems.

Traditional imaging, for example, will always be slower than directly implanting a chip into the brain. The targets in MRI imaging (hippocampus, amygdala

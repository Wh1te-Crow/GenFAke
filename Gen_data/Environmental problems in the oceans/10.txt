Environmental problems in the oceans are associated with excessive nutrients as well as nitrogen runoff into the oceans, which has the effect of depleting seawater of oxygen. Ammonia and nitrogen poisoning are by far the leading causes of death in humans and marine mammals from ingestion, and the release of these chemicals into the ocean has had serious impacts on marine ecosystems and marine species. Because of this, it is critical to tackle excess nutrient runoff to increase the concentration of oxygen in the ocean. Fortunately, increasing understanding of the natural process of ocean acidification has led to more rapid research, development, and validation of important environmental restoration measures and mitigation strategies.

Ocean acidification results from the release of carbon and other substances into the oceans, which cause the ocean to absorb up to one

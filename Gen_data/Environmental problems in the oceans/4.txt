Environmental problems in the oceans are well documented. Ocean acidification could not be more destructive to marine organisms. Acidic seawater is harmful to shellfish, coral reefs, and marine life. Coral reefs play a vital role in the ocean ecosystem and contribute to the carbon and nutrient cycle by filtering out toxic or less desirable nutrients. Acidification is expected to harm more than 50 percent of marine species by the end of this century.

U.S. coastal communities are at risk from rising ocean levels and ocean acidification. Now, more than 40 million Americans live within 5 miles of a coastal coastal marsh, known as a "buffered bay." Researchers believe the effects of rising ocean levels on that sea are more severe than previously thought.

Environmental problems in the oceans are certainly a concern in Canada, and I would argue, globally. Environmental degradation of the oceans are of concern to society as a whole as they affect many forms of life including us.

My hope is that in the future Canada will take an approach that sees the ocean as one of our greatest resources for economic development and development as a country that can feed its population in a sustainable manner.

My vision of a healthy, healthy, healthy Canada is one where coastal communities will be able to make that environmentally sustainable lifestyle decision. I think that's important to make it more appealing to get your kids interested in the outdoors and continue doing that so that we can continue to have healthy populations. I believe that is the way forward.
